## choice
###### _A specialised file format for defining functional tree structures._

Please refer to the [wiki](https://github.com/dakodabutnot/choice/wiki) for information on how Choice is written and structured.

If you are interested in how the language is interpreted, I am currently _trying_ to build an interpreter in **Java**, which can be found [here](https://github.com/dakodabutnot/java-choice).

There's also an Atom language package [here](https://github.com/dakodabutnot/language-choice).
